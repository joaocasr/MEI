-The shared_buffers parameter determines how much memory is dedicated to the server for caching data. 

The value should be set to 15% to 25% of the machineâ€™s total RAM.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-The work_mem parameter basically provides the amount of memory to be used by internal sort operations and hash tables before writing to temporary disk files (work_mem is allocated dynamically for query operations ).
->allocated in the private memory of the base backend process that needs it

optimal work_mem = Total RAM * 0.25 / max_connections
