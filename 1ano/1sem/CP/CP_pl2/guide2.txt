a)

the memory accesses on the matrix C and A exhibit spatial locality. However, the iteration
of the matrix B does not exhibit spatial locality. The data in the matrixes are placed in
memory continuously in a row-major order, so if we are iterating the elements like we are doing
in matrix B (by column) we are accessing distant addresses from memory (this can lead to huge
latency as the N grows since the blocks loaded from memory are from certain size).

N = 128
